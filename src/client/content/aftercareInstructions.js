    instructionsOne:
      "Leave the bandage on for as little as two hours or overnight to 24 hours. Do not reapply the bandage. Wash the area gently with water and a mild, fragrance-free soap such as Liquid Dial, Dove, or Ivory. Do this using CLEAN HANDS to remove all excess ointment, blood, and ink. Pat dry with a clean paper towel. DO NOT SCRUB.",
    headerTwo: "Routine care",
    instructionsTwo:
      "Wash your tattoo 2-3 times daily for the first few days. After washing, allow the skin to dry and apply a VERY THIN layer of Aquaphor for 2 to 3 days. Always wash your tattoo with fragrance-free soap before you apply or reapply the Aquaphor. You may experience clogged pores during healing; this is normal and will not affect your tattoo. On the 3rd or 4th day, switch to a mild, fragrance-free moisturizing lotion such as Curel, Lubriderm, or Aveeno until the tattoo settles into the skin. This typically takes three weeks to one month. It is normal for your tattoo to look hazy during this time. Expect to see your tattoo peel and flake. It is completely normal for your tattoo to itch, but it is imperative NOT TO SCRATCH OR PICK YOUR TATTOO. NO DIRECT AND PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO SUN for two weeks. After that, apply sunblock to your tattoo when exposed. NO SWIMMING OR SOAKING for two weeks.",

    title: "Tegaderm Bandage Instructions",
    headerOne: "Bandage application",
    instructionsOne:
      "TEGADERM should be applied within one hour of completing the new tattoo. Moisture from the open skin prevents the adhesive from sticking to the new tattoo. Apply TEGADERM to CLEAN DRY SKIN with no residue from the tattoo process. TEGADERM should cover the tattoo with one inch all around for good adhesion. Glycerin in green soap residue will react with the adhesive and should be rinsed well before TEGADERM is applied. TEGADERM should stay in place for THREE DAYS while the skin is open and producing fluid. After 24 HOURS, the bandage can be removed and replaced. The second application can stay in place for TWO DAYS if it sticks well to the skin with minimal fluid build-up. If the tattoo is smaller and simpler in design and there is no fluid build-up up then the initial application can stay in place for the full THREE DAYS. IF REDNESS OCCURS, REMOVE THE TEGADERM, DISCONTINUE USE AND FOLLOW THE ALTERNATIVE AFTERCARE INSTRUCTIONS ABOVE. If you are allergic to adhesives, test a small piece on your skin. Redness will clear once the TEGADERM is removed, and the tattoo will not be affected.",
    headerTwo: "Bandage removal",
    instructionsTwo:
      "TO REMOVE TEGADERM: peel it back over itself, not away from the body. Avoid stretching the skin. Once TEGADERM is removed, clean and dry the area and proceed with your preferred topical aftercare NO DIRECT AND PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO SUN for two weeks. After that, apply sunblock to your tattoo when exposed. NO SWIMMING OR SOAKING for two weeks.",
