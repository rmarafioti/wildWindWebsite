      "This place is fantastic! I loved my experience working with Rich. He had such passion and he's very helpful guiding the experience. I relied on his expertise when I was getting two tattoos covered up with a bigger tattoo. He was great to talk with, I loved the relaxing jazz music in the shop and the vibrant art was so cheerful, so inviting. Rich and I kept in touch and he checked my tattoo out a month later to see how it healed. I've told my friends to go see Rich and I can't recommend enough! Thank you!",

      "Rich did such an amazing job on tattoos for me and my friend. It was my friend's first tattoo and he was really great about walking her through the process and aftercare and made us both feel very at home. I walked in not really know what I wanted to get (other than some vague inspiration), but even with the lack of detail, Rich managed to design a piece that was absolutely perfect for me. I couldn't be happier with how it turned out!",

      "I've never felt calmer while getting a tattoo. Rich is a sweetheart. I felt absolutely comfortable in that they wanted to make sure I liked the pieces and placement before proceeding. Also, some really neat vintage thrifted trinkets, unique artwork, a sense of humor, and really great tunes. The healing process has gone flawlessly in the past two weeks. So professional while also enjoyable and chill.",

      "I scheduled an appointment with Rich a few months in advance and I'm so glad I did! The shop is adorable, the employees are lovely, and the work they do there is impeccable. I have a follow up next month and I can't wait to go back. I highly recommend it. Just make sure you call ahead if you're looking to do a walk in as this place is busy - and for good reason! Great shop, 10/10",
